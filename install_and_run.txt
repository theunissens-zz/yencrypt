Assuming golang is installed, and project is put in gopath directory structure
 - /src/github.com/put_project_here (yencrypt)

Install

1. Install postgres service and make sure it is running on machine.
2. Add user to postgres;
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
    (If you get an authentication error connecting to postgres, this is probably needed)
3. Run: go get github.com/lib/pq. This installs the postgres lib/driver
4. Run: 'go build' in yencrypt_server folder to generate binary in that folder
5. Run: 'go build' in yencrypt_client folder to generate binary in that folder

Run
1. Run server called yencrypt_server: yencrypt_server <port>
    eg: ./yencrypt_server 54321
1. Run client called yencrypt_client:
    - yencrypt_client <port> <encrpyt> <id> <absoluteFilePathToPlaintext> (Create a file somewhere on disk and put some plaintext you want to encrypt inside.)
    eg. ./yencrypt_client 54321 encrypt someId C:\Folder1\plaintext.txt (lets say its content is; "HelloWorld")

    Output
    Key: abcdefg (some base64 string)

    - yencrypt_client <port> <decrypt> <id> <key>
    eg. ./yencrypt_client 54321 decrypt someId abcdefg

    Output
    Plaintext: HelloWorld


Some notes
- The database name is 'yotest', hopefully it does not clash. You can change it in y_db.go if it does.
- We are connecting to the database on default port 5432, and default username (postgres) with password (postgres)
